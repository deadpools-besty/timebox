# Couple Depressed Boys HackED 2021 Project

## Description (from a reddit comment):

>  It would have you roll a virtual die, (or give an option for two dice as well, for slightly longer timeboxing), and then switch 
 to a timer all set up for the chosen number of minutes. I hit start and begin working. 
 At the end of the timebox it rings an alarm (that could be set to whatever alarm sound file I choose) and 
 takes me back to the dice screen to roll again. The dice screen doesn't need to have dice animations, 
 though it could. It could also just be a random number generator from 1-6 ( or 2-12 if I pick two dice). 
 In this way it randomizes timeboxing and makes it more game-like.
 > I've been doing this on my own with online dice and a timer app, 
but it would save me a little time if there was an app
built to help with it. All of the timeboxing apps in the
Play Store only allow you to pick one length for all your timeboxes.
It would be great if the app had a dark theme option too.
